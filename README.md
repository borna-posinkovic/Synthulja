# Synthulja
basic synthesiser, work in progress


DISCLAIMER: Example project using JUCE framework, I'm doing this for educational purposes, it isn't meant to be very good, just to help me improve my C++ knowledge and learn the JUCE framework better, in hopes I will make better apps one day.


Features:

1. Two oscillators with selectable waveforms (sine, saw, square)
2. ADSR envelope
3. Filter (state variable filter from JUCE DSP module)

To do:
1. Add gain sliders to control the oscillator volume
2. Add frequency adjustments to the oscillators (to allow for more octaves)
3. Maybe add another filter
4. Add an LFO
5. Find a better oscillator library or make one from scratch
6. Add a menu to select MIDI controller
